    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained model achieved a **test accuracy of 88%** and a **test loss of 0.3473** on the EMNIST balanced dataset. These results indicate that the model has learned meaningful patterns from the data and generalizes reasonably well on unseen samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a total of **229,807 trainable parameters**, the model remains lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for applications with limited computational resources (e.g., mobile OCR systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, an 88% accuracy also suggests that the model still misclassifies approximately 1 out of every 8 characters. The most frequently mistake are caused by Visually similar characters such as `'O'` vs `'0'`, `'l'` vs `'1'`, or `'S'` vs `'5'`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Recommendations for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data augmentation:** Introduce variations in rotation, scaling, and distortion to improve the model's robustness to real-world handwriting variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expand the model slightly:** Consider increasing the number of filters or adding a residual block (ResNet-inspired) to better learn deeper features without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use pre-trained backbones:** Explore transfer learning using lightweight pre-trained CNNs like MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet with fine-tuning, to leverage richer features with fewer training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Train on combined datasets:** Combine EMNIST with other handwriting datasets (e.g., IAM, HW-R) to improve generalization and account for style diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Move to sequence modeling:** Upgrade to word and sentence handwriting recognition level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deploy interactive demo:** Package the model into a web app (e.g., using Streamlit or Gradio) to visualize real-time predictions and get feedback from users for further improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrates how a CNN can be used to classify handwritten characters from the EMNIST dataset. The pipeline includes end-to-end data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. With further enhancements such as data augmentation or model tuning, this system can be deployed in real-world handwritten OCR applications.\n",
